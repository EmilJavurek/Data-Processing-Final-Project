https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/2657.To_Kill_a_Mockingbird,To Kill a Mockingbird,Harper Lee,"The unforgettable novel of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town and the crisis of conscience that rocked it. ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" became both an instant bestseller and a critical success when it was first published in 1960. It went on to win the Pulitzer Prize in 1961 and was later made into an Academy Award-winning film, also a classic. Compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" takes readers to the roots of human behavior - to innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humor and pathos. Now with over 18 million copies in print and translated into forty languages, this regional story by a young Alabama woman claims universal appeal. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today it is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature.",4.27,5496473,107032,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Academic', 'School', 'Literature', 'Young Adult', 'Historical', 'Academic', 'Read For School', 'Novels', 'Young Adult', 'High School']"
https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/61439040-1984,1984,George Orwell,"The new novel by George Orwell is the major work towards which all his previous writing has pointed. Critics have hailed it as his ""most solid, most brilliant"" work. Though the story of Nineteen Eighty-Four takes place thirty-five years hence, it is in every sense timely. The scene is London, where there has been no new housing since 1950 and where the city-wide slums are called Victory Mansions. Science has abandoned Man for the State. As every citizen knows only too well, war is peace. To Winston Smith, a young man who works in the Ministry of Truth (Minitru for short), come two people who transform this life completely. One is Julia, whom he meets after she hands him a slip reading, ""I love you."" The other is O'Brien, who tells him, ""We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness."" The way in which Winston is betrayed by the one and, against his own desires and instincts, ultimately betrays the other, makes a story of mounting drama and suspense.

https://www.goodreads.com//book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice,Pride and Prejudice,Jane Austen,"Since its immediate success in 1813,   has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work ""her own darling child"" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, ""as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print."" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.",4.28,3790284,94286,"['Classics', 'Fiction', 'Romance', 'Historical', 'Historical Fiction', 'Literature', 'Historical', 'Novels', 'Audiobook', 'Romance', 'Historical Romance', 'Adult']"
